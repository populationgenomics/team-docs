config
======


At the CPG, we heavily rely on TOML files to configure our applications. This module provides a simple interface to load CPG configs.

A CPG config is generated each time you use the analysis-runner, with some default settings.

This is exposed as the ``CPG_CONFIG_PATH`` environment variable.
