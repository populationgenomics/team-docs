# CPG and XPG IDs

- `XPG` prefixed IDs are used to identity _Samples_,
- `CPG` prefixed IDs are used to identify _Sequencing Groups_.

We should NOT publish these identifiers, or the name of any dataset (in most cases).

## If we do publish them

If we do publish these IDs, we should:

1. create a pull-request to delete these IDs, and then,
1. an organisation owner can request PR deletion from [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?flow=pr_removal&subject=Delete%20Pull%20Request&tags=rr-remove-data).
