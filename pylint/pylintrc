# 1. f-string-without-interpolation (we allow f-strings that don't do any
#    formatting for consistent looks and for future safety)
# 2. inherit-non-class ("Inheriting 'NamedTuple', which is not a class" false
#    positive, see: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3876)
# 3. too-few-public-methods (produces false positives)
