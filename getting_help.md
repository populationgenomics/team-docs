# Getting help at the CPG

Problems happen, we get it! If you've tried searching this site and still no dice, jump over to #software-questions to ask. To make it easy for us to determine what your issue is, please try to follow this format:

> **Tagline for request**
>
> - What you're trying to accomplish, including any relevant context.
> - Steps you've already taken to solve this problem.
> - If you're linking a batch, please try to pull out specific stacktrace
>
> You should almost certainly include:
>
> - Links to failing batches
> - Links to your code (even better with line numbers, and a specific Git Hash or branch name)
>
> Extra tips:
>
> - Please use slack formatting for code, stacktraces, clarity, etc
> - Please let us know on the slack message if there are specific deadlines, and if you need us to live debug with you (as opposed to providing debug suggestions).
> - If you're taking screenshots (awesome), please try to include the URL so it's easy for us to see where you are.
