Welcome to populationgenomics's documentation!
==============================================

Welcome to the Centre for Population Genomics! We're glad to have you here :)

This repository contains documentation you might find useful as you onboard, but and as an ongoing reference. We sometimes let these docs fall out of date, so please have a chat on Slack if something seems unclear - or open a pull request!

If you need help more urgently, don't hesitate to ask directly on Slack (e.g. in
the `#team-data` or `#software-questions` channels).
